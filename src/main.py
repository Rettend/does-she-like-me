# I know this sounds silly, but I thought maybe if I could create an algorithm that could
# tell me the truth, I would feel better.

# But every time I run the code, it says no. And every time, it hurts more.
# At first, I didn’t believe it. I thought maybe there was a bug in the code, or a typo, or
# a logical error. I checked and double-checked everything, but I couldn’t find any mistake.
# Just give me one yes. Just once. The code was flawless. But the answer was still no.

# How could that be? She must like me, right? She smiled at me once, she laughed at my jokes,
# she touched my arm. Those were signs, weren’t they? Or maybe they were just random
# fluctuations in the space-time continuum. Then, I got angry. I thought maybe the code was lying
# to me, or mocking me, or playing with my feelings. I cursed and yelled at the code, but it didn’t
# change anything. It still said no.

# Why was it so cruel? Why couldn’t it just say yes? Why couldn’t she just say yes? What did I do
# wrong? What did she want from me? https://igotstandardsbro.com/
# Next, I tried to bargain. I thought maybe if I changed something about myself, or about the code,
# or about the situation, the answer would change too. I tried different inputs, different outputs,
# different scenarios. I tried to be more confident, more funny, more attractive. I tried to be less
# needy, less clingy, less desperate. But nothing worked. It still said no. What else could I do?

# After that, I felt depressed. I thought maybe there was no point in trying anymore. The code was
# right. She didn’t like me. She never liked me. She never will like me. No one will ever like me.
# I’m worthless. I’m hopeless. I’m alone. Running the code was just a reminder of how pathetic and
# miserable I am. Why did I even bother? Why did I even care?

# Finally, I accepted it. I realized that running the code over and over again was insane. The
# definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different
# result. That’s what Einstein said, right? He was a smart guy. He knew what he was talking about.
# The code was not going to change its mind. She was not going to change her mind. I had to change
# my mind.

# So this is it. This is the last time I run this code. This is the last time I ask this question.
# This is the last time I hope for a different answer.
# Does she like me?
# No.
# OK.
# Goodbye.
